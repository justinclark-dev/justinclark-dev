<h1>Campaign Dashboard</h1>
<p>This was a proprietary advertising reporting dashboard that was used by account managers from ABC, Disney, and ESPN for monitoring their campaign performance and for generating billing data for all advertisements that ran on all the company's websites.

  <h2>About this Project</h2>
  <hr>

  <p>
    This project was the culmination of my 11 years working for the wonderful Walt Disney company.  I actually started off as a advertising reporting analyst manually compiling small handful of spreadsheets a day. One day I found out about recording macros in Excel and how you could view the code, let alone manipulated it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long story short, I taught myself how to program and to be developer, a designer, and all-around tech junkie. Along the way I helped turn a highly manual ad reporting process into a multi-server, multi-language, ad reporting web application with automated UI deployments.
