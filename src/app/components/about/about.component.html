<h2>Originally self-taught on the job</h2>
<p>
  My introduction to programming came in the real world on the job.  While working as a Team Lead for a team of Reporting Analyst at Disney, a member of my team showed me how to access VBA code that was generated by recording macros in MS Excel.  I began by first recording small macros to achieve small efficiencies, then I took the code generated from the smaller macros and combined the code together to create very quick, very accurate, and very efficient automation of report generation in Excel.

<h2>Getting my Associate’s Degree in 2020</h2>
<p>
  Over the years I’ve learned many new technologies and programming languages, enough so that I can quickly get up to speed on any new technology or language. Still, I feel that to be the best developer I can be, and to be competitive, it’s really best to have a well-rounded education that is complete with a degree.  So, after I finish my AA in Programming, I will start working on my Bachelor’s Degree in Application Development.

<h2>I love challenges, solutions more so</h2>
<p>
  As with anything, developing websites and web applications takes time and patience as there are always new challenges to overcome.  But that’s one of the main reasons I love being a developer. So, I constantly struggle with new challenges in order to grow.
</p>

<h2>Great teams require great team members</h2>
<p>
  I’m always open to new challenges and opportunities, so if you are looking for someone to join your team, please contact me.  I’m a team player and enjoy the camaraderie and synergy of a great team.
